        <p>
          I'm Kristopher Kohlmeier, a recent Computer Science graduate 
          working part-time managing, running, and maintaining the 
          stage A/V equipment at Crossroads Church, located in
          Camarillo CA. Currently, I'm building my software engineering 
          skills to pursue a career in CG animation technology. 
          Animated films were a big part of my childhood, and to this 
          day I'm inspired by great stories that are told through 
          animation. In my spare time, I listen to music, build custom
          keyboards, bake, and play co-op and social games.

          Initially I started as a volunteer at Crossroads and enjoyed
          the oppourtunity to work on the technology behind
          the scenes of a production. As a result, I taught myself
          A/V production by reading the manuals for the equipment,
          and used online resourses to learn best practices and
          standards for live productions. Since taking on this role 
          I've played a key role in training volunteer teams and 
          elevating weekly production quality with new hardware and 
          software installs, while maintaining and repairing old A/V equipment.
