        <p>
          Hi, I'm Kristopher. I currently work at Crossroads Church is Camarillo
          supporting their weekly live services by managing, maintaining, and operating
          their production equipment, as well as leading and supporting their volunteer
          production team. I love solving problems, tackling new challenges and learning new systems to implement into production workflows. I also have 
          experience with writing software and I'm always looking for opportunities to
          improve this skillset of mine. In fact, this website will soon be replaced
          with a shiny new one soon, as I've been expanding my skills from low level
          code and databases into frontent web development utilizing frameworks such
          as Vue.js and React!
