          PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES

        <p>
          Hi, I’m Kristopher. I currently serve on the production team at Crossroads Church in Camarillo, where I manage, maintain, and operate production equipment to support weekly live services. I also lead and support a dedicated team of volunteers who help bring each service to life.

I’m passionate about solving technical problems, learning new systems, and streamlining production workflows. Alongside my work in live events, I have experience writing low-level software and working with relational databases.

          I enjoy...<br><br>
          playing tabletop games<br>
          playing cooperative games<br>
          building custom keyboards and computers<br>
          analyzing film and animation<br>
          learning behind the scenes fun facts<br>
          listening to music while working<br>
          and baking the occasional sweet treat!
