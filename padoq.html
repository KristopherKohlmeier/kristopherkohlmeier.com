          OVERVIEW

        <p>
          Padoq is web-app joint venture I'm currently working on between another software 
          engineer and a buisness/project manager. The goal of my involvment in this 
          venture is to help bring a successful MVP of the web-app to market within a set
          development timeframe. To acheive our release goal we are following a hybrid
          waterfall and scrum development pattern. Currently the technology stack being used 
          to develop the project is Vue and Ionic for frontend, and Firebase to handle the backend. Once 
          the project is officially released this portion of the site will be a development
          blog that goes into greater detail on the specifics of the project.
