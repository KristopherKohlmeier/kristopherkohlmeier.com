        <p>
          I'm working on Padoq, a web-app joint venture between another 
          software engineer and a business/project manager. The goal of 
          my involvement in this venture is to help bring a successful 
          MVP of the web app to market within a set development timeframe. 
          We are following a hybrid waterfall and scrum development pattern 
          to achieve our release goal. The technology stack used to develop 
          the project is Vue and Ionic for the front end. At the same time, 
          Firebase is utilized to handle the back end. Once the project is 
          officially released, this portion of the site will be a development 
          blog that details the project's specifics.
