          Story Development Software, or SDS is a personal project of mine that began 
          as my final semester project in College. The project consisted of market research 
          for CG animation pipelies and software solutions that currently exist for storyboard 
          management. By the end of the project I produced a working prototype for a client-server 
          interface that injested storyboards and .EDL files and displayed the result of 
          the current ordering of the storyboards and relevant metadata from the editing software.

          Some highlights from this project include: A custom MySQL backend I developed for 
          data handling; A custom network protocol I designed and implemented between clients 
          and servers; and a build script for the initial server setup. The aim of the 
          programming portion of this project was to apply skills learned in my database and 
          network programming courses to a field of my interest. Moving forward I'm currently
          refactoring this project, utilizing existing technologies to create a more polished
          software, and implementing base features used by current industry softwares as well
          as implementing new features to make it stand out in the market.
