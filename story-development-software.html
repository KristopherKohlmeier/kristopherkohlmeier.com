          OVERVIEW
        </title>

        
         <p class="sds-paragraph">
          Story Development Software (SDS) was my senior capstone project, focused on analyzing the market for CG animation workflows with an emphasis on storyboard management tools.

Through research, I identified a major gap: few solutions existed for storyboard management within CG film pipelines, and existing options lacked key features sought by studios. For the programming portion, I designed and built a prototype client–server interface that ingested storyboards and EDL (Edit Decision List) files, then displayed the current sequence of storyboards along with metadata from editing software.

The project delivered a functional proof-of-concept that demonstrated how editorial and pre-visualization workflows could begin to be more effectively integrated.

          Highlights: 
          Developed a custom MySQL backend for data handling, designed and implemented a custom client–server network protocol, and created a build script for automated server setup. The programming portion applied concepts from database and network programming coursework to a real-world animation pipeline.
